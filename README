Molybdenum: a framework for files / directories scanning, manipilation, watching.


It is under initial development now. Examples and documentations will be added soon.

The framework is partly ready for usage. The ques, dir structures, directory
filters are ready (partly at least). These tools allow easy scan and cmpare
directories, filter them by a parameter. If you interested in these tools please
contact me and I'll write an example.

The signals (notification) are "under construction". It is the big show stopper for the moment.

Keep in touch.
I will be back soon.
